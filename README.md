# Airbnb-Case-Study
This repository contains a data analysis project on Airbnb listings in New York, including insights on customer preferences, host acquisition, and property optimization for revenue growth.

This project aims to perform a thorough analysis of the Airbnb New York dataset in order to provide insights that can help increase the revenue of Airbnb. The dataset contains information about different Airbnb listings along with their hosts, locations, prices, and other attributes.

The project consists of two presentations, one for the Data Analysis Managers and Lead Data Analyst, and the other for the Head of Acquisitions and Operations and the Head of User Experience, NYC. In addition, a methodology document is included that showcases the methodology that was undertaken for the analysis along with all the steps/codes that were performed in detail.
